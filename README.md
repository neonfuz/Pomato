# Pomato

Pomato is a simple productivity timer, based on the Pomodoro Technique. It
shows your currently remaining time in the favicon, and is meant to be pinned as
an app tab.

## Features
As of writing, it currently just counts down from 25 minutes and has a reset
button, but in the future I plan on adding a break feature, adjustable time,
time tracking, and syncing across devices.
