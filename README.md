# Pomato

Test it out at [pomato.surge.sh](https://pomato.surge.sh/)

Pomato is a simple productivity timer, based on the [Pomodoro
Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). It shows your
currently remaining time in the favicon, and is meant to be pinned as an app
tab.

## Features
Currently it counts down from 25 minutes (or whatever the user sets), and has a
reset button. In the future I plan on adding breaks, time tracking / logging,
and syncing across devices (login with social media / github?).
