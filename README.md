# Pomato

Test it out at https://pomato.surge.sh/

Pomato is a simple productivity timer, based on the Pomodoro Technique. It
shows your currently remaining time in the favicon, and is meant to be pinned as
an app tab.

## Features
Currently it counts down from 25 minutes (or whatever the user sets), and has a
reset button. In the future I plan on adding breaks, time tracking / logging,
and syncing across devices (login with social media / github?).
